# Hello_World
My first step in GitHub.
Here,I want to touch more different thoughts about programming.I'm a new learner.And so far I learn java on my own,only by watching vedios and typing codes on Eclipse,compiling it ,watching it runs.But I think it is far from enough to cultivate myself into a good programmer.I want to learn more ,see more and communicate more with other professional programmers.As I chose to learn it,then I want to learn it well,to love it,and to be good at it.
